# Vehicle Allocation and Selection System

This project implements a vehicle selection and allocation system using graph data structures. It contains classes to model a graph of vehicles, allocation panels, and related structures for optimized vehicle management and selection.

## Project Structure

The following Java classes are part of this project:

- **VehicleSelection.java**: Handles the logic for selecting vehicles based on certain criteria.
- **Node.java**: Represents a node in the graph, modeling a vehicle or station.
- **Edge.java**: Represents a connection between nodes in the graph, with associated attributes like distance or time.
- **Graph.java**: Manages the graph data structure, allowing for operations such as adding nodes, edges, and finding optimal paths.
- **DSA.java**: Implements various data structure algorithms to be used in conjunction with the vehicle allocation system.
- **AllocationPanel.java**: Implements a panel that handles the allocation of vehicles in the system.
- **AllocationDisplay.java**: Manages the UI display for vehicle allocation, giving visual feedback to users.

## Features

- **Graph-based Vehicle Selection**: The system allows vehicle selection based on a graph representation of stations and routes.
- **Optimal Path Calculation**: Utilizes graph traversal techniques to compute the optimal path between nodes.
- **Dynamic Allocation Panels**: Provides a dynamic panel for vehicle allocation and management.
- **UI Integration**: Incorporates UI components for displaying and interacting with vehicle allocation information.

## Usage

1. **Graph Setup**: Define your graph with nodes representing vehicles or stations and edges representing the connections or routes between them.
2. **Vehicle Selection**: Use the `VehicleSelection` class to handle the logic for choosing the best vehicle based on available criteria.
3. **Display Allocation**: The `AllocationDisplay` and `AllocationPanel` classes will help display and manage the allocated vehicles through a graphical interface.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-allocation-system.git
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
3. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   java VehicleSelection
## Future Improvements
**Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implement advanced pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra or A* to optimize vehicle allocation.
**Real-time Data**: Integrate real-time vehicle tracking and update the graph dynamically.
**UI Enhancements**: Improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and responsive.

## Dependencies
This project requires a working installation of Java (version 8 or higher).
